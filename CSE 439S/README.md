# iOS Mobile Application - Veni Vidi- a book and movie documentary app

This folder contains all the files for the Advanced Mobile App (iOS) development course.
I was on a team of three, and we develop a mobile app that helped users refresh their memories and creations. In the project, we incorporate Core Data for data storage and syncing, SnapKit and DCFrame for UI design. We also adopted APIs such as Google Books, IGDB, etc.
